Lent isn't a magical make things better button. If you want to emerge closer to God than you started it does  that effort. You have to actually be intentional. And that's exactly what's so great about it. Mother Church in her wisdom created a regular interval to pulled out of our everyday and invite to go higher. "Hey! It's time to climb! And here's people with ashes on their head to remind you."
The marketing of lent is kinda amazing. This random penitential day that isn't a holy day of obligation is the 3rd most attended mass, with a giant gap to #4. People love the ashes. And it's fitting that one of the most memorable days is the opener for the most intentional season of the church. "Hey everyone! Pay attention! The important time is starting!"
