      <b>"Star Beasts Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Wrap"</b>
      is a classic forums-style Let's Play of Star Beasts: Asteroid Version, a
      ROM hack of Pokémon Red that's halfway between a reimagining of the
      original Generation 1 games and an adaptation of Vast Fame's unlicensed
      Taiwanese Game Boy RPG Shi Kong Xing Shou ("Space-Time Star Beasts"),
      featuring a full suite of brand new creatures plus new characters and
      locations.
    </p>

      I went into the game completely blind and had an absolute blast playing
      it. I've divided my playthrough up into 25 Episodes, with one releasing
      every day of December 2025 in the style of an Advent Calendar. Each post
      is accompanied with not just detailed commentary and plenty of
      screenshots, but original edits and gags as well. It's my hope that this
      thread will delight any fan of Pokémon, ROM hacking, bootleg gaming
      history, Metalworking, Signboards that Secrete Human Blood, or Italian
      Eurodance group Eiffel 65 this holiday season.
