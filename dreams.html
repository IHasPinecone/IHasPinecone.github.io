            Youtube added a feature where you could see how much money lifetime the ads you've watched have generated for Youtube. My number was 4 figures and it sent me into a downward spiral of depression. I think I went to live in the woods.

           My old roommate was working as a bartender at a high end bar. I asked him what he reccomeneded I get. He got really nervous and said "Well we have the Ronald Reagen platter." I said sure and he put six 8oz fireballs in a basket with about 30 Walmart cookies, a giant bowl of shredded lettuce with pickles on top, and a few water bottles. I was like "wtf i'm not paying $100 for fireballs and some shitty salad" and left.

            I was watching a high school production of a musical based on the myth of Achilles. Except Achilles in the opening song keeps talking to the crowd saying he has read this story before and is determined to not make the same mistake again.

            I was a poor person in Victorian England who found a small cheap theater that did productions of classics plays. Except the curator would sit in the cheap seats with us and just make fun of everyone in the expensive seats. Eventually the actors would go off script and make fun of the rich people too. It turned into a Victorian Rocky Horror Picture Show thing where I kept coming back not for the plays but for the fun experience.

            I got added to a group chat with Quintin Smith, Internet Shaquille, and a really small youtuber i'd never heard of. (Apparently they were all friends) The chat was made so they could all give me advice on how to run my TTRPG campaign and I was upset because I thought my campaign sucked and it was a waste of their time to look at it.

            Evangelion's ending was completely different. Eva Unit 1 was completely feral and scrambling around the earth killing angels. It was like that state it was in crawling around on all 4s. It sustained that for like years. Basically everyone is dead except Shinji, who's following the Eva unit around like he's a friend of the iron giant if the iron giant ripped beasts apart with its bare hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the years went by the Eva Unit kept falling apart more and more until one day a laser samurai shows up and cuts a massive slash across the Eva's face, killing it. Shiny was pretty neutral on the situation. He was following the Eva more out of habit than anything else.

            I've had this recurring dream the past few weeks where everyone in my college house actually lives in a log cabin in the snowy mountains. The looks of the cabin have been extremely consistent in every dream. I could with 100% accuracy draw the floor plan for this cabin. And it's got a hot tub on the second floor balcony. Plus one of my good friends from high school that I havn't talked with in a few years also lives with us.

            I was at my extended family's lakehouse and a massive oil rig boat was parked right on the end of our dock. I was super pissed at my brother for giving them permission to be there because they were killing all the minnows and plant life in the lake. Most of the dream was just me screaming about how evil the people who run the rig are.
