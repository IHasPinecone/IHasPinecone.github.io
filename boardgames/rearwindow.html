      Oh boy we talking about a Hitchcock film today. Or at least a game based on a Hitchcock film. And I do promise, i’m not a fake fan. I have seen clips of this movie on Youtube. Havn’t seen the movie itself but I at least knew of it ok?
    </p>

      Rear Window is a communication game in the vein of like a Mysterium. The game is based on a Hitchcock film of the same name. One player is the Director, they are given a secret set of information, that they need to communicate to their audience, where the audience is the rest of the players. To communicate this information they are given these picture cards. And they place those cards in different windows on the board to hopefully have their audience understand everything. Basically the director wants to tell the audience things, but only have so many scene cards to do it in. If the director successfully communicates then everyone wins. It’s a cooperative game. If the director doesn’t give good clues, or the audience does a bad job of guessing, or both then everyone loses.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Rear Window is far from the first game of this type, I think it challenges some core beliefs of the genre to great effect. I’ve already mentioned Mysterium, which is probably the most popular game of this type. Personally, I never really loved Mysterium, the game always felt very sluggish. The cards in this game were always super unhelpful, with a million little details and nothing connecting them, so it often felt like a crapshoot whether my audience would correctly guess the info. The cards are super weird and vague, and they didn’t line up with anything players were trying to guess. Like how does a bathtub, a spider, a bunch of gears relate. Players might assume I’m talking about technology so they go with the clock, maybe evilness so they go with the whip. It’s all very very vague. Although, I assume this was intentional. In theory, the fun of this genre is using weird limited communication. I assume the designers wanted this to be a fun challenge, but like I said I was often more frustrated than challenged. It was like the designers handing me crayons and asking me to make a crossword. These tools are so not fit for the job that’s it’s just not fun.

      Rear Window is different because the cards actually are quite useful. Pictures on a Mysterium card are strange and silly. Pictures in Rear Window depict the important characters, doing things related to what players need to guess. So if the director wants to say the yellow lady is in this room, they could just put a bunch of pictures featuring the yellow lady in that room. Or if they need to communicate characters going on a date, there’s plenty of pictures that could be interpreted as characters going on a date. The pictures are quite helpful and clear. Upon hearing that you may be wondering why this game is interesting if the clues are so helpful. Like I said, in Mysterium the fun theoretically is how hard it is to communicate. If the pictures are helpful, where’s the challenge? Well, it’s like trying to fly a plane. These easy to use cards give the plane are very smooth tarmac to take off and land from. Once we are using a smooth tarmac, we can turn our attention to the more nuanced parts of flying a plane like deploying landing gear and flaps and such.

      In Mysterium you only need to communicate like 3 things over 3 rounds. It was Colonol Mustard in the Ballroom with the Candlestick type beat. Rear Window conversely asks the director to communicate a whopping 8 pieces of information over only 4 rounds. And while in Mysterium you’re given a wealth of cards to choose from, Rear Window doesn’t give you any extra cards. You have 8 cards per round, and 8 slots to put them. You are allowed to put up to 2 cards face down in a round if you have no use for them, but you get how limiting this is. Information is easier to communicate, but you need to communicate much more, with less resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes playing the game quite interesting. This picture might have the yellow lady on it, and the yellow lady is in this room, but oh no the picture also has her listening to music, so the card will also be useful in a different room. Where do you think your audience needs more help? Do you want to gamble on more yellow lady cards showing up in later rounds?

      And lets say it’s nearing the end of the game, and your audience still hasn’t figured out that the gardener is in this room, and you have no clues for the gardener to give them. The game also gives you these 3 “redraw” tokens they can use to redraw their hand. Maybe it’s worth burning one of those now because you really really need a gardener clue. Or if you have a bunch of mediocre clues, maybe you redraw them hoping for things more useful? Something you might notice, viewer, is that there’s a lot more game in Rear Window vs Mysterium. Like I said earlier, Mysterium is all about how hard it’s cards are to use. That’s the whole game, there’s not really anything else to it. The game just tosses you some wacky cards and says “figure it out champ, here’s some MC Esher Stairs, a Necronomicon, and a plant growing human heads. Rear Window gives you more useful cards, but gives you some different decisions to make as well. Sure figuring out which cards will be most helpful still exists in Rear Window, but like any good movie it’s paced out through the game. A game of nothing but weird logic can get a little boring. By spacing out the weird logic between more concrete mechanical game decisions Rear Window becomes a more well paced game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The director isn’t the only one with these interesting gamey decisions to make, the audience does as well. The audience has these 4 once/game powers. So while the audience tries to unpick the director’s logic, sprinkled in are moments of “do we want to use this power now or later” “do we think this is the best time for the power?” “Which card do we use the power on?” These are, like I said, more concrete mechanical decisions to make between all the weird ethereal discussion about what the heck the director is getting at with these clues.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these player powers have some sauce to them. By far the most interesting power is this arrow token. To use it, the audience chooses a card and the director gets to place this arrow wherever they want on the card. First off, I havn’t seen this type of thing used in any game like this. Which is kinda crazy because it feels like it really plays to the genre’s strengths. But the biggest reason I love this power is how many interesting ways the audience can use it. Do they use it on a clue early to lock in some info? Do they use it really late when they will most need it? When they do use it, which clue do they use it on? Which clue are they most unsure about? Will the arrow even help them figure it out? The decisions players have to make here are so juicy. I love this mechanic. The other once/game powers are really cool too. And again, the real beauty of these powers is they give the game better pacing. They break up following the weird logic for a bit to play a little minigame. Playing mysterium was just nothing but really weird and strange logic games between really weird and strange cards. I’ve had much more fun with Rear Window because it feels more concrete.
I’m contrasting this game a lot to Mysterium because I feel Mysterium’s method is the obvious design choice. Make the challenge hard by making communicating anything hard. Make all the pictures super unhelpful and let comedy ensue. “You idiots, you were supposed to know the ball in that picture is made out of rubber, so the clown is the killer!” and then their friends say “How were we supposed to know that? That’s crazy logic” and so on and so on. That’s the obvious way to make this game. But Rear Window surprised me by going completely contrary to this. The game gives you very useful cards, and leaves it up to you to use them most efficiently.

      Murderer!:
And, this wouldn’t be a game about film without a really cool twist at the end. What if, the director, that you thought was on your side this whole time, has actually been working against you! In about one-third of games, the game actually switches its goals. In Mysterium the director and the audience are in 100% cooperation. But in Rear Window the director might have been dealt a killer in one of the rooms. Now, the game is actually a competitive game. It’s the director vs the audience, because the director wants to keep the killer secret from the audience, and the audience wants to find where the killer is and predict the twist ending. Both teams still want 90% of the information communicated correctly, but there is direct compeition over the room with the killer in it. And, only the director knows if there even is a killer in this game. The audience not only needs to find the killer, it’s very likely there isn’t even one.

On paper this rule feels like it wouldn’t work. How is the audience supposed to guess there’s a murder if the director doesn’t want to tell them? Well, have you ever seen a murder mystery? It’s never one clue that gives it away, it’s lots of little clues that all line. One thing the audience will have to look out for, is if the director routinely doesn’t give you good clues for one room. It’s unlikely the director wants to waste their precious cards giving players info for one of the nonessential rooms, because remember for the director to win they still need to communicate 90% of the info correctly. But there’s a ton of other hints too. Just as another, example one of the audience once-per-game powers is to ask the director to verify if a given piece of info is correct, and they must answer truthfully. So if the director is trying to mislead you and have you think a character is a gardener, and you ask them to verify this with this power, they might be forced to admit that character isn’t a gardener. If the clues strongly hint this character is a gardener, but this player power showed with certainty they aren’t a gardener, you probably have to assume that character is a murderer. Again, there’s so many subtle ways to determine whether there’s a murderer I can’t go over them all here. Viewer, you might just have to trust me when I say “yeah, this mechanic is pretty great”
    </p>
    <p>
      Because again, on it’s face this mechanic seems ridiculous. It feels there’s no way it should work, but given a ton of really subtle design choices in this game, it just works. And like I mentioned earlier, when it works it creates a very concrete little minigame the players can play to break up the crazy logic untying. Rear Window’s genius is including these little minigames to make the clue guessing shine more.

For the record btw, you could take out this module if you’re playing with a more casual crowd. You could play without a murderer and the game still plays very well. I would only play with this if I was with a more gamer-focused crowd.

Making this genre more gamey is really good. If the whole experience is just trying to follow bizarre leaps in logic the game can feel arbitrary. That’s still the main course of the game, but these more gamey elements are the green beans and mashed potatoes to go with your main course.

      Conclusion:
So this game is based on a movie, a classic Hitchcock movie. So if you didn’t recognize IT, I will have to give you this “I’m uncultured T-shit.” I’m sorry I don’t make the rules. I myself have am dodging any “uncultured” acusations because I’ve had the wikipedia page for El Topo open in my browser for like a week. So there. Anyway, despite the movie coming out like 40… million years ago, this game was released very recently in 2022. We really are in a golden age of party games. Gone are the days of Pictionary’s tyrannical rule. Instead of just guessing words at parties we can do so much more. We are spoiled for choice for really fun and really unique and varied party games. We don’t just have to resort to guessing words based on actions and drawings.

So Clover
Decrypto
Hue’s and Cues
Wavelength
All of the Jackbox Games
Don’t Get Got

We have so many tools for being funny with friends. Some of these games are more complex than others, but not all. So Clover for instance can really be played by anyone of any age. Same w/ Hue’s and Cues and Wavelength. And every year more of these games are coming out. 

By the way, shout out to my Welsh friend who has bought a copy for me. At time of recording I could only find really expensive copies of this game in the US, but for whatever reason there’s plentiful copies in the UK. So my friend bought like 5 copies of this game and is distributing them to all us americans when we meet up in Serbia next summer. You know, standard operating procedure. Yeah shout out to him, you’re a real one for getting me a physical copy of this game.
Anyway gamers, goodnight.
