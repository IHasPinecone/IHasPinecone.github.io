      The worst part about all this is i’m talking about multiple games here, and so i’m gonna have to explain rules for all three, while somehow staying engaging. My instincts are telling me this enterprise might be doomed from the start. But, well. Momma didn’t raise a quitter so we are gonna rip it anyway.

      When my friends and I play our board games we play a mixture of old and new favorites. But when some of us started looking back and seeing which games we keep coming back to, we started to notice a trend. And in identifying what unites some of our favorite games we think we’ve found an interesting little subgenre. That subgenre is Hell. (flash fire with sound effect) Someone as a joke started calling these “misery-type” games because what makes these games unique is how awful it feels to play them. Just really really doesn’t feel great to play these games. And viewer I will remind these are the games we keep coming back to. These “misery-type” games might warrant us all getting some sort of masochist status. The name became an in-joke for a while, I’m pretty sure it started as riffing on “Strand-type” games, which is something Hideo Kojima said offhand in an interview when talking about Death Stranding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This joke of calling games “misery-types” was getting more and more common, whenever we’d play one of these games someone would chirp about it being a “misery-type,” so I decided to do a little Litmus Test to see if this is just a meme or if there’s something real we are onto here. I independently quizzed people in the group asking them if X game is or is not a misery-type. Mainly I was interested in discovering whether misery-type is just shorthand for “game we like” and I found that not to be the case. My friends all seemed to be in independent unanimous agreement which games were and were not misery types, and it wasn’t correlated to whether we liked the game or not. There were games we liked that we agree didn’t fit the mold. And things we would consider archetypal misery types, but we just didn’t like. Even though we didn’t have a direct definition somehow we’d come to some consensus about what a misery-type game is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you all will have to bear with me. Rather than a strict definition, I think it’ll be easier to go with examples of misery types. I'm gonna expand on one very specific way a game can be miserable. By focusing on one brand of misery hopefully you’ll have a better idea of what this weird subgenre is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first game i’m talking about is Estates. And i’ll tell you what, if you viewer couldn’t understand why someone would feel pain while playing a board game, this one would be the one to show you. This is a game about money, have the most money at the end and you win.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while i’m teaching you the rules to this game I might be talking about how you make money and all that, and a natural question you might say is “how much money roughly does the winner have at the end?” As your theoretical teacher, I would say something in response like “Oh, how many points is a winning score? Um. Yeah um good question. Good question. Um you could win this game with a score of anywhere from like 10 points to like… 100? Depends on how bad things go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s not me being funny. That’s actually how this game goes. When you sit down to play this game you have no idea whether we are in a race for maximum profit, or just gonna be tackling each other in a mud pit trying to score a little profit before the game ends. This is a game as much about making your opponents lose money, as it is making yourself.
    </p>
    <p>This gets to what makes a game miserable. The one specific way a game can be miserable i’m talking about here, is that misery-types make achievement hard. Misery-types are not the sort of games where you can look down at the end of the game and at least feel proud of what you’ve accomplished. If you’re losing one of these games, it’s probably because by the end everything was taken from you. It’s possible you end the game in a worse state than you started. You start a game of Estates with $10 for instance. So if you end with like $5, the only thing you did in this game is lose money. Board games don’t often have merch, but I think it’d be funny to get a shirt that said like “I played a 2 hour game of Estates and all I did was lose $5” formatted like one of those stupid shirts you get at touristy places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estates’s Specific Mechanics
      So how does Estates do it? How do you make/lose money in this game?
      In Estates you will be Real Estate companies putting up buildings. To find how much a building is worth you add up all the numbers of pieces used to construct the tower. So a massive 5 block tower might be worth $20 all by itself while a tiny one block building is only worth $3. But a building will only be worth points if it has a roof put on top of it. Now most games would end it there. A normal game would be content with saying “well all that work is worth nothing because you didn’t put a roof on. It’s just zero points. We will just call it a wash.” But Estates goes further. It’s not just that an incomplete building isn’t worth any money, it actually loses you money. All the money you would make if there was a roof, you actually lose all that money. That’s how you can end this game with less money than you started. You might get stuck with a massively overambitious building, and any buildings you finished that did make money, are made completely irrelevant because of how massive of a loss this one building is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first arm of Estate’s attack against your happiness is the threat these unfinished buildings represent. You’ll spend the entire game nervous, wondering if you’ll actually manage to put a roof on these buildings or if you’re gonna just lose all those points. And the second attack on your happiness is that buildings only score for the player whose color tile is on the top. So while you’re trying to construct your buildings to make your profit, there’s always the threat that someone plops one of their own tiles on top of yours, now that tower scores for them. So not only do you have to get roofs on your buildings quickly to avoid the negative points, you need to top your buildings quickly so no one just takes it from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      There really is a brutality to Estates. That’s probably it’s most defining feature. Everything in this game is so all or nothing. Either you complete the building and score positively, or don’t and it goes all the way into the negative. Either your color is the top floor so you can score it, or it’s not. There’s no ways to hedge to get half rewards or something. Either something goes completely your way, or completely not your way. It makes playing this game a little scary. This game asks for POWER MOVES ONLY. No pussyfooting around here. You gotta go all in and try to make something happen. And the scariness, of knowing you gotta do a play, is the misery. Every turn in this game is agonizing because it will either be a massive boon for you, or not. There’s no halfway.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, this game makes progress difficult. How the hell are you as a player supposed to make money when making money runs the risk of losing money, or just having your projects stolen out from under you? That viewer is the intriguing part of this game. The deck seems unbelievably stacked against success. This is what I mean that this game is miserable. You’ll play two hours of this game, be a nervous wreck the whole time, and still end worse than you started. Man this game is good. Oh I didn’t even mention. Winning this game doesn’t require actually constructing anything. There’s a viable strategy in this game, where if you think no one is going to make money, you just play spoiler. You take your starting capital, embezzle it into a tiny amount of money for the end of the game, and just ruin everyone else’s construction projects. Any game where you win just by ruining everyone else’s day has to be worthy of the misery type moniker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I continue onto the next game I should say something. Misery-Type games kinda by default are bad for new players. If you're new to games, we want you having fun as soon as possible. Ideally you do something cool within the first 10 mins of your first game. Other games will let you look down at what you'll built. You now have a cool bird to look at that's giving you value. Or maybe you've got a monopoly on some resource. Heck yeah man. That's cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Misery-types don't give you any free senses of accomplishment. Your sense of accomplishment is hard won. Here's really the key, if you don't fully understand the rules of a misery type you won't have a good time. Because you'll lose and it'll hurt, and you'll feel lost and feel the hobby isn't for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do understand the rules though, when you lose you'll be able to think. "Oh that's what lead to my demise" That's the insidious tricks these games pull. Losing hurts, so your brain starts to think of ways to avoid it. And once your brain is theory-crafting strategies? Guess what you're off to the races. This hobby now has its hooks in you. You're a gamer now. Make sure to make your Board Game Geek account on the way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve done this awkward segway into talking about simpler games because the next game i’m talking about is actually quite simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Container Mechanics
      Container really shows that misery is for everyone. Here’s the entire game. Players will be buying and selling crates from each other but the key is this: you can’t buy your own product. If you have it, you need to convince someone else to buy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, i’ll show you the lifecycle of crates. This is genuinely all the rules of the game. First off crates are manufactured in factories. Factories are made by paying the price listed on the spaces. And players can pay $1 to produce with all your factories. Then crates are bought by other players to put in their warehouses. While inside the warehouses the crates get to enjoy the nice seaside property waiting for another player’s cargo barge to come pick them up. When the barge stops by the player then buys the crates from the warehouses, putting them on the ship. And finally the ship carries the crates to the center island, where there is a blind auction among all players for these crates, the player who delivers those crates will then collect the winning bid, and get paid an additional equal payment from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Container Vibe
      Container is very simulative. The speed and tempo of the game don’t feel like something hardcoded into the rules. The game will play out quite differently based on who is around the table and how they are feeling. The price of crates doesn’t feel like something that can be mathed out and gamed. You just gotta set prices for other players using your gut a little. If everyone is ok paying $3 for crates, that’s gonna be their price. It’s possible in an identical board states but different players the agreed on price for crates is $2, or $4. It all depends on the players at the table. There’s a shared gumbo made as everyone brings their own ideas and choices to this invisible market you create. Lots of games like to emulate a market and its forces, but Container is just a full fledged simulation of a simple economy. This invisible, almost imperceptible yet unique market made by the players, might cause the floor to shift out from under you, and send you spiraling into a crazy debt you can’t claw out of.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see when you’re buying all those warehouses and factories you might notice something, these prices are awfully high! It’s not out of the question that you buy two warehouses turn one, then spend the rest of the game just trying to claw out of that deficit. In one game your investment might work out amazing, as people are ok buying your crates with you large upcharge. But in another game people might decide they don’t want your overpriced crates and the game slows down. In that second world you’ve got some massive problems to solve. This is where you’ll feel the anguish. You’ve made yourself vulnerable by buying all these warehouses, and no one wants to pay prices to make those warehouses worth it. Sitting there, knowing you’re losing, and trying to pull yourself out of this state is so fun. And it sucks so bad. Every turn you realize “Oh I should have done that” or “oh I might have an opportunity to make a big sum of cash here” this heads up thinking knowing another slip up will send you into the shadow realm is addicting. And being on the top isn’t any less miserable. If you have lots of money to work with you’re actually under the most pressure. You’re in a winning state, you just gotta keep it up. But anything you invest in has the chance of turning to ash if other players don’t behave like you expect them to. Because anyone who has a lead in this game has the most to lose, it’s possible the one winning the game is suffering even more than the person losing. You just can’t feel safe while playing this game. And that’s really the hallmark of a misery type. Misery type games keep tension because your game is always balanced on a knife’s edge. Anything you have can and will be taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a story that happened to me in an actual game. Early on I made the right call, I think I had double the cash of any other player at the table. So I decided to take my fat stacks of cash, and buy some nice juicy shipments to the center island, where that bank subsidy comes from. I thought I could just coast on this lead until the end. I thought that as long as I make a little money per turn i’ll win. I didn’t want anything to do anything super risky. So I was willing to buy crates for high prices, because I was ok with thinner margins, because i’m already in this lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan worked out fine for a while, I was getting mediocre return and no one was gaining on me. Then, the invisible market shifted for no obvious reason and crates went up in price while the price people were bidding on the final island went down, I sent one terrible shipment to the island with expensive cargo and lost a ton. A couple more turns and my supposedly safe bet just completely lost. Something I can’t communicate with this is how funny this moment is. Like, genuine comedy as we all see nothing in the board state change, but everyone’s mood shifts and someone loses bad because of it. Whenever you spend money in this game, you have to be ok with never seeing that money again. Because every price you pay in this game has risk. It’s possible the invisible market made by you and the other players shifts invisibly and your investment rots in your barns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told that story partially because to show how you never should feel safe in this game, but also I told it because it’s thought provoking. Even now i’m thinking about how I could’ve played it diffeSomething also about Container is that it’s very simple. Many misery types are very complicated games, meant for more hardcore gamers. But Container’s rules could be explained in like 5 minutes. Honestly i could’ve just included an entire teach of this game here, but I didn’t want to interrupt the flow. Again this game’s rules could be explained in like 5 minutes. This game really shows that misery-types are for everyone. You don’t have to be a hardcore gaming weirdo to enjoy a misery type. Misery is for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you do want a more complicated version of Contaienr, I wanna shout out Tokyo Tushigi Fish Market, this game feels a lot like container, but with like 10 expansions. If you liked Container but wish it had more meat on its bones you could do a lot worse than this game. Only bad thing is it’s hyper out of print, and our of the 7 mods on tabletop simulator, or only works. At time of recording the only way to play this game easily is through my mod, which credits the original creator and links to his paypal if you wanna chuck him some money. There are like 6 other mods on Tabletop Simulator but they have broken assets, so i’ll leave a link to my mod somewhere, wherever you’re listening to this.
      ...rently to maintain my lead, or wondering what I should’ve been on the lookout for. Losing in these games is obvious and painful, so my brain keeps wanting to go back and reexamine my play, looking for where I made a mistake. Sometimes I feel this is harder to do in more easygoing euro games. These games don’t have plays that hurt and feel bad, so it’s not anywhere near as obvious when you have made a bad play. Something great about misery types is they really make you feel your failures so you want to get better. And thinking about games and trying to get better is a large part of enjoying games in the first place. Sometimes what takes you from just liking a game to loving it is theory crafting. And a game that threatens to reset all your progress like Container or Estates really get you theory crafting like few other games do in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tokyo Fish Market
      Now Contianer may be simple, it may be a game that breaks down barriers and proves that misery is for everyone. But if you want something that’s the complete opposite I am gonna mention Tokyo Fish Market. That game feels a lot like container, but with like 10 expansions. If you liked Container but wish it had more meat on its bones you could do a lot worse than this game. Only bad thing is it’s hyper out of print, and out of the 7 mods on tabletop simulator, or only works. At time of recording the only way to play this game easily is through my mod, which credits the original creator and links to his paypal if you wanna chuck him some money. There are like 6 other mods on Tabletop Simulator but they have broken assets, so i’ll leave a link to my mod somewhere, wherever you’re listening to this.

    <p>
      Guilty Gear Xrd
      I love all the games i’ve mentioned. Games of this type really make me feel like no other game does, they give me gameplay I can’t get anywhere else. And for the record you don’t have to be an economic game to be miserable, or even this brand of misery. Sometime I’m probably going to write about Pax Transhumanity. That game is just a euro game, but you can spin you wheels a lot in that game. It’s easy to get halfway through the game, everyone looks up at each other panting and realizes none of you are any closer to winning than you started. I gotta talk about that game sometime, but I’ve got a neat final anecdote here.
      I was talking with my brother about how these games uniquely made me feel and he told me about the fighting game Guilty Gear Xrd. 
      (Guilty Gear Trailer)
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that defines this game is how bad being in the corner is. This is a 2D fighting game, and if your opponent has you trapped in the corner, you’re probably dead. Even though you might have health, your defensive tools are just very limited, and more importantly their offensive tools are fully online. You have to deal with a lot if you’re in a corner. You gotta fight for your life if you wanna get out of the corner. And on the flipside if you have your opponent in the corner, it’s go time. Now’s the time to go in for the kill. The whole round you were trying to get this moment, you gotta press your advantage now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fans of Guilty Gear Xrd love the game because of this feeling. Fighting for your life to get out of the corner, and fully hitting the gas on the other side. All 2D fighters have corner play, but in Guilty Gear it’s especially bad. Like, 10x worse than more contemporary games. Now, corners being so bad makes the game less swingy. If someone starts the set winning, they are most likely going to keep winning. Many modern games try to make things more swingy. Someone getting beat early, then making a comeback is hype. And it doesn’t happen as often in Xrd. In fact, when the devs went back to make the next Guilty Gear game after Xrd they toned down how bad the corner is. Once you have someone in a corner, you can only deal so much damage to them, before the wall breaks and everyone gets reset to the middle of the stage. The new Guilty Gear Strive is a very popular game, so clearly many people like this mechanic. But there’s some hardcore fans that prefered how it was, so they stay with the old game. Because this new game doesn’t make them feel the same way. That’s how I feel misery types are. Broader audiences might not like them as much, and designers might actually intentionally make their games to avoid this type of design. Super not swingy corner play might be boring, but that helpless feeling trying to fight out of the corner is what makes the game fun for some.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, there’s some pretty real proof that broad audiences don’t like misery types. Stonemaier games is one of the most successful modern publishers, and they specifically avoid making games designed like this. And every game i’ve talked about here, are all hyper out of print. These are not games that can sustain massive print runs and stay on store shelves for years and years. Despite their design being super engaging, it seems only weirdos want to buy them. Pax Transhumanity only had one print run I could find, and it’s very hard to find secondhand. Estates is in a similar boat. I’ve already mentioned how it’s basically impossible to play Tsuchigi Fish Market. At least Container seems to get rereleased with a small print run every decade or so. But the point is it seems this design is destined to be niche, which is fine. Board Games are a large enough space where we can have niche games. And I’ll probably be playing them my whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s a great wide world of games out there. And for this little gamer, well. I’ve got something I love. I love all sorts of games, but this little sub-genre, these misery-likes, they hold a special place in my heart. And like i’ve said many times already, something common in this genre is this difficulty in making progress. If you want to end up better than where you started, you gotta work for it. And even if you work hard, you might get outplayed and end up even worse. There’s economic games that crush you with massive payments either at the beginning or at the end of the game, like Container and Estates, and there’s other games that cause this miserable effect by letting your opponents thwart your plans and turn your efforts to dust like Pax Transhumanity. And I love these because it’s engaging to think about these things, and engaging to suffer in that misery. When things go wrong, I actually smile a little because I’m addicted to that feeling of things going wrong. I love it. Honestly, that’s one reason I love board games as much as I do, it’s because of these crazy feelings they have me feel. The rush of triumphing despite hardship, the panic of being balanced on a knife’s edge, the pain of being sent into negative points after a high risk play didn’t work out. Those extreme experiences are why I love these games. I think these experiences are actually what carried me from being a casual board game fan, into a more hardcore one who would spend his free time making little essays and reading them into a microphone. I owe a lot to these games. So, thank you misery type games. Thanks for making me the freak I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s other things that make something a misery type. There’s plenty of misery types that don’t have this fact at all. And honestly if we are being abstract quote “worse than you started” is actually a pretty bad term. Theoretically we could say every turn in Monopoly you lose $10 and it would have this quality without exactly feeling like a misery type. The feeling is much more important than the facts of the game. Misery-types as a genre are more about the pain you feel while playing. You gotta feel hurt in your gut when a plan falls through, you gotta feel the tension when it just threatens to. And the game can’t really distract you with other things. You can’t say “well I lost but at least I build a big train line in Ticket to Ride” no. No consolation prizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might write some more things talking about what else makes a misery type. I had a lot of fun writing and filming this so I might do another one.
      If you ever had misery you’ve experienced in a game feel free to comment it or DM me on discord or something. I’m interested if people outside my weird friend group have experienced this feeling. Alright gamers. Goodnight.
