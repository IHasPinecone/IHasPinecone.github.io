      Have you ever been wrong, like really wrong? For the first time in my life I am. Rear Window changed the way I look at an entire genre of board games.  This genre is communication games. One player places cards out to communicate information to the other players. To say there’s a clock, they might put out a bed and some electricity. Because alarm clocks wake people up and there's electricity in clocks. And it's up to the rest of the players to decode that logic correctly. Previously I thought the core premise of the genre was unfun. And Rear Window proved me so wrong. Where other games in the genre zig, Rear Window zags. It challenges every assumption and reengineers the genre from first principles. Looking at this game must have been what classical painters thought when they saw Van Gogh. Ok maybe not that crazy but I think you get my point.

      The most popular game in this subgenre is probably Mysterium. And personally, I never really loved Mysterium, the game always felt very sluggish. The cards in this game are intentionally very complicated. There’s a million little details on these cards and they don’t share a common theme. When I played Mysterium it often felt like a crapshoot whether my audience would correctly guess the info. Sometimes the players would understand what I meant, but just as often the players would hyperfocus on some small detail I didn’t intend and the whole game would be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back at that clock example. The director put out the electricity and the bed. Except the electricty card has handcuffs, and now the audience are completly off track because they've decided to hyperfocus on the handcuffs. No matter what I do there’s things to distract my audience.

      I assume this frustration was intentional. “If this is a game about communication, let’s make communicating hard. If the cards were easy to use there’d be no game.” That makes sense, but it was never fun for me. It was like the designers handing me crayons and asking me to make a crossword. These tools are just frustrating. Here's Rear Windows first big departure look at these cards compared with Mysterium's!

    <figcaption class="centertext">
      <i>Look at those cards! So simple! So relavent! No wonder the other players correctly guessed my genius clues!</i>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Need to reference the yellow lady? There she is! Need to say something about a musician? Look at all those instruments! Mysterium in the same position would've just throw you cars with MC Esher Stairs, a Necronomicon, and a plant growing human heads and say "Figure it out champ!" These easy cards give Rear Window a smooth foundation to build off of. Or if you prefer a movie metaphor, it's a nice clean set to film your movie with. The simple cards means Rear Window asks you convey a lot more information than Mysterium. Players need to guess 4 characters, in 4 rooms, doing 4 activities. And you don't have many cards to do it with. The director just makes a lot more interesting decisions about where to put their best clues.

      The director isn’t the only one with these interesting gamey decisions to make, the audience does as well. The audience has these once-per-game powers. So while the audience tries to unpick the director’s logic, sprinkled in are moments of “do we want to use this power now or later” “do we think this is the best time for the power?” “Which card do we use the power on?” These are concrete mechanical decisions sprinkled into the more ethereal discussion about what the heck the director is getting at with these clues. That’s Rear Window’s secret. Arguing about the director’s weird logic is still in the game, but it’s paced out. Like any good movie, pacing is important. A whole game about nothing but wibbly-wobbly logic chains would get old fast.

      And these player powers have some sauce to them. The coolest is this arrow token. The audience chooses a card and the director places the arrow wherever they want on the card. First off, I havn’t seen this type of thing used in any game like this. Which is kinda crazy because it feels like it really plays to the genre’s strengths. But the biggest reason I love this power is how many interesting ways the audience can use it. Do they use it on a clue early to lock in some info? Do they use it really late when they will most need it? When they do use it, which clue do they use it on? Which clue are they most unsure about? Will the arrow even help them figure it out? It’s so juicy. The other once/game powers are really cool too.

      This wouldn’t be a game about film without a really cool twist at the end. The director, that you thought was on your side this whole time, actually might be working against you! In about one-third of games, the game switches its goals. In Mysterium the director and the audience are in 100% cooperation. But in Rear Window the director might have been dealt a killer in one of the rooms. Now, the game is actually a competitive game. It’s the director vs the audience, because the director wants to keep the killer secret from the audience, and the audience wants to find where the killer is and predict the twist ending. Both teams still want 90% of the information communicated correctly, but there is direct compeition over the room with the killer in it. And, only the director knows if there even is a killer in this game. The audience not only needs to find the killer, it’s very likely there isn’t even one.

    <p>
      On paper this rule feels like it wouldn’t work. How is the audience supposed to guess there’s a murder if the director doesn’t want to tell them? Well, have you ever seen a murder mystery? It’s never one clue that gives it away, it’s lots of little clues that all line. One thing the audience will have to look out for, is if the director routinely doesn’t give you good clues for one room. It’s unlikely the director wants to waste their precious cards giving players info for one of the nonessential rooms, because remember for the director to win they still need to communicate 90% of the info correctly. But there’s a ton of other hints too. Just as another, example one of the audience once-per-game powers is to ask the director to verify if a given piece of info is correct, and they must answer truthfully. So if the director is trying to mislead you and have you think a character is a gardener, and you ask them to verify this with this power, they might be forced to admit that character isn’t a gardener. If the clues strongly hint this character is a gardener, but this player power showed with certainty they aren’t a gardener, you probably have to assume that character is a murderer. Again, there’s so many subtle ways to determine whether there’s a murderer I can’t go over them all here. Viewer, you might just have to trust me when I say “yeah, this mechanic is pretty great”

      Because again, on it’s face this mechanic seems ridiculous. It feels there’s no way it should work, but given a ton of really subtle design choices in this game, it just works. And like I mentioned earlier, when it works it creates a very concrete little minigame the players can play to break up the crazy logic untying. Rear Window’s genius is including these little minigames to make the clue guessing shine more. For the record btw, you could take out this module if you’re playing with a more casual crowd. You could play without a murderer and the game still plays very well. I would only play with this if I was with a more gamer-focused crowd.

      Anyway, despite the movie coming out like 40… million years ago, this game was released very recently in 2022. We really are in a golden age of party games. Gone are the days of Pictionary’s tyrannical rule. Instead of just guessing words at parties we can do so much more. We are spoiled for choice for really fun and really unique and varied party games. We don’t just have to resort to guessing words based on actions and drawings. We have so many tools for being funny with friends. Some of these games are more complex than others, but not all. So Clover for instance can really be played by anyone of any age. Same w/ Hue’s and Cues and Wavelength. And every year more of these games are coming out.

      Shout out to my Ukrainian friend, living in Wales, visiting me on vacation in Serbia who gave me this game so I could bring it back to America. At time of writing I could only find really expensive copies of this game in the US, but for whatever reason there’s plentiful copies in the UK.
