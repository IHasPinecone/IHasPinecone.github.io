      Have you ever been wrong, like really wrong? Rear Window is a game in a genre i'd completely written off. The genre is cool in theory, but in excecution I thought it super unfun. And Rear Window proved me so wrong. Where other games in the genre zig, Rear Window zags. It challenges every assumption and reengineers the genre from first principles. Looking at this game must have been what classical painters thought when they saw Van Gogh. Ok maybe not that crazy but I think you get my point.

        This game is based on a Hitchcock film and I promise i'm not a fake fan. I've seen clips of this movie on youtube. </i>

      This genre is communication games. One player places cards out to communicate information to the other players. To say there’s a clock, they might put out a bed and some electricity. Because alarm clocks wake people up and there's electricity in clocks. And it's up to the rest of the players to decode that logic correctly. The most popular game in this subgenre is probably Mysterium.
